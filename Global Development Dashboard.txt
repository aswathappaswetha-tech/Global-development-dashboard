Global Development Dashboard
Interactive Data Visualization Project
📌 Overview
This project explores global development indicators across 100+ countries using an interactive dashboard. It visualizes relationships between life expectancy, GDP per capita, health expenditure, fertility rates, and child mortality, helping reveal global disparities and development patterns.
The goal is to turn raw data into clear, actionable insights through effective data storytelling.

📊 Key Features
- World map showing life expectancy clusters
- Top 10 GDP per capita ranking
- KPI panel summarizing global averages
- Health vs Life Expectancy scatter plot
- Fertility vs Income scatter plot
- Child mortality distribution
- Color‑coded clusters and bubble sizes for intuitive comparison

🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Tableau / Power BI / Excel (choose the tool you used)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Calculated fields and KPI design
- Clustering and segmentation
- Dashboard layout and storytelling

📂 Dataset
The dataset includes:
- Life Expectancy
- GDP per Capita
- Health Expenditure
- Total Fertility Rate
- Child Mortality
(Add a dataset link here if it’s publicly available.)

🔍 Insights & Findings
- Higher health expenditure is strongly associated with higher life expectancy
- Income and fertility show an inverse relationship
- Clear segmentation between high‑income and low‑income regions
- Child mortality remains significantly higher in low‑income clusters

🎯 What I Learned
- Designing multi‑sheet dashboards with consistent formatting
- Building KPIs and calculated fields
- Applying clustering to segment countries
- Improving color theory, layout, and user experience
- Turning complex datasets into meaningful visual stories
