# 🌍 Global Development Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes global development indicators such as GDP per capita, life expectancy, inflation, and health metrics across countries.  
The goal is to provide an interactive dashboard that helps compare countries and identify development patterns using data visualization.

This project was created as part of my data analytics portfolio.
